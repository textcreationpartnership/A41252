            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>WHether it was agreeable to the Wisdom of a Parliament, to Petition the Kings Majesty, to issue forth a <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> to discourage and punish a great part of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties faithful Subjects, in such a day as this is, when Trading is very low, Money scarce, the Nation very Poor, its Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial City lying in the Dust, and most of the People of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on expecting <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> as a Soveraign Remedy for all these Diseases?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query II.</hi> Whether it had not been more pleasing to God, and to the generality of this Nation, more for the honour of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> more agreeable to right Policy, and more for the Good and Prosperity of the whole Nation, for the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to have Petitioned the <hi>King,</hi> to make good <hi>His Declaration from Breda,</hi> and to grant his faithful Subjects <hi>Liberty to Worship God according to their Consciences?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query III.</hi> Whether it was agreeable to true Wisdom and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, to pass such a Vote, so suddenly, before the House was full, without any consideration, or considerable Debate, about the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of it; and afterwards to repeat the same Vote (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that it was opposed by Eminent Persons with Unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Reasons) upon uncertain Reports of some tumultuous Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> without examining whether the Reports were true or no; and when those Reports were malitiously sent to the House, and would upon a thorow examination have appeared very false: for those People are, and have been very careful not to abuse the favour they received; and the Body of the Nation knows this is so?</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:57443:3"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Query IV.</hi> Whether if some persons had been tumultuous in their Meetings (as it was reported) it was fit, or agreeable to rules of Prudence, to punish the whole party for it, when the particular Offenders might have been punished; and whereas it might have been more rationally concluded, that those tumults were made by some persons that only pretended to be of that party, or that were instigated to it, by some, on purpose to hinder the hoped for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query V.</hi> Whether the passing of such a Vote, and the making of such a Petition to the King, upon a few Letters from particular persons, and some flying Reports of the miscarriages of some <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists,</hi> was not more unbecoming the Wisdom of a Parliament, than the proceedings of the Long Parliament against the Bishops, which was done upon Petitions from most Counties in <hi>England,</hi> and the general complaint of the Nation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query VI.</hi> Whether it was agreeable to the Wisdom and Policy of a Parliament, to pass a Vote to bring in a Bill for renewing of the Act against Conventicles, for three years longer, at a time when the House was engaged in another great Affair, and had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day for Debating (according to the Kings desire in his Speech) what way was left for uniting the Kings <hi>Protestant Subjects?</hi> And whereas God never left following the Nation, with some severe Judgments since that Law was first made, until the execution of it was relaxed hath not the Nation sufficiently felt the evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And have we not seen that when these Laws were left unexecuted, Trade revived, and mens minds were more satisfied? And is it agreeable to true Policy, when we have felt the sad effects of a Law, to revive it again, and <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> when we can expect no better Consequences of it then we had before?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query VII.</hi> Whether the noise of the present proceedings against the Noncomformists, and the severity intended, doth not much sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57443:3"/>the hearts of most of the Kings faithful Subjects, and discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them in their Callings and Tradings, so that their Discourse is of Transplanting themselves, calling in their Debts, putting off their Stocks, contracting their Trades; and whether this will not have a destructive influence upon the Trade of the whole Nation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query VIII.</hi> Whether the Persons against whom this present Severity is to be exercised, and the Laws executed, are not such as deserve their Liberty, and to be favoured in what they differ from the publick Profession, being in their Principles loyal, in their Lives sober and industrious, in number very great multitudes of all sorts, many of them of great Learning and Abilities, fit for Counsel and the managing of great Affairs; of great Reputation at home, and in forreign Nations; of great Relations and Interest in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; of great Courage and Conduct, and able to do the Nation great service; men spread abroad in all parts of the Land, of all Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Trades, industriously contributing to the Publick good, and bearing a very great part of the Taxes, Burdens, and Trade of the Nation; Persons that are earnest with God for the Prosperity of <hi>England,</hi> and that mourned and prayed under all its Calamities; such as have, and are ready to give sufficient security for their peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able living under the present Civil Government; such as are as good Subjects, and have as good an Interest in the Soyle as any <hi>Englishmen</hi> whatever; such as have been great sufferers in the late Judgements that befel the Nation, and assisted the Nation in all its Publick Concerns, with their Persons and Estates, and have been ready to bear all Publick Charges, Taxes, or Burdens; and have in all their Sufferings quietly submitted to the Penalties of the Law, and not in the least endeavoured to deliver themselves by any indirect means, notwithstanding they have not been (had they not been conscientious persons) without opportunities to do something that way. Are there not many of them that were great Instruments in restoring the King to his Crown, and multitudes that were never concerned in the late Civil <hi>War,</hi> and all of them, such as have carried themselves quietly and peaceably since his Majesties Restauration, notwithstanding the great discouragments and oppressions that they have lien under?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query IX.</hi> Whether it stands with the Interest of the Nation, to persecute and destroy those that are true Protestants, and that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57443:4"/>own the same Religion, and Faith (for the substance of it) with all other Protestants in the Nation, and are ready to maintain the truth of the Protestant Religion against all gain-sayers, and have written effectually to that purpose, and whose Interest it is to have that Religion preserved and protected; and who differ from the Publick Profession of the Nation, in that only which they in their Consciences think <hi>sinful,</hi> and those in Power think <hi>Indifferent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query X.</hi> Whether these People concerned in the present se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, are not for their Number, their Principles and Loyalty, their Parts and Wisdom, their Riches and Interest, their Conduct and Reputation, their Industry and manner of Living, as capable to make the Nation prosperous, and to serve the <hi>King,</hi> if they were favoured, as those that are encouraged by him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query XI.</hi> Whether for Magistrates with external force and penalties to pursue, punish or destroy their Subjects, of the same Religion with themselves, in the substance of it, because they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from them in some Observances about it, be not contrary to Christianity and Prudence? The Scripture, that's the Rule of Christianity, hath not one tittle to countenance such a practice, but on the contrary, there are many commands, exhortations, and examples for Liberty, Moderation, and mutual Forbearance in such things: neither was there any such practice as this known for the first 300 years, neither did Christian Emperours practise it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Antichrist began to get to his Power: And it hath been lately evidently proved, (both by Scripture and Reason) <hi>That no Prince nor State, ought by force to compel men, to any part of the Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or Discipline of the Gospel.</hi> Prudence directs us to a quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry practice, to do nothing to disturb and destroy men that are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to contribute their utmost assistance for Publick good; to dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the minds of the generality of the Nation, to discourage them in their Callings; to drive them to transplant themselves, and to remove their Stocks to other Nations, and so consequently to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverish the Land: And all this for not agreeing in Opinion with others, about such things wherein the peace and welfare of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not concerned?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query XII.</hi> Whether it is not Gods Prerogative to Rule the Consciences of men, and that it is dangerous for any man, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men, to lord it over the Consciences of others, to impose
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57443:4"/>any thing upon them in the Worship of God, or to force them to any thing against their Consciences? And whether men in impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing things upon others Consciences, do not make themselves In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falible, and set themselves in the place of God, and so bring down inevitable Judgements upon their own heads?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query XIII.</hi> Whether it had not been more becoming the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Magistrate, to use means to inform his Subjects in the matters in question, and so deal with them like rational Creatures, not to persecute them with force and corporal Punishments, and so deal with them like Beasts?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query XIV.</hi> Whether it had not been more pleasing to God, more for the satisfaction and good of the Nation, more for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of King and Parliament, for the Parliament to have Petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King to put all the Penal Laws in execution against common Drunkards, Swearers, Whoremongers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to have past a Vote, <hi>That no common Swearer, Drunkard, Whoremaster, nor Ignorant or Scandalous person, should have any place of Preferment in the Church;</hi> and then I believe there had been many Parishes, if not Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks, freed from their present Incumbants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query XV.</hi> Whether there are so many able Preachers setled in the Nation, as that it is fit to exclude so many hundreds of able Preachers, dedicated to that work? and whether mens Souls do not starve in many parts of the Nation, for want of Spiritual food?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query XVI.</hi> Whether the Effects of Persecution in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where it hath been practised, have not been sad? hath it not brought down Judgments upon those Nations, and proved for the certain impoverishing of them, and hath it not been so in <hi>England?</hi> And on the contrary, How prosperous have those Nations been that have granted <hi>Liberty of Conscience?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query XVII.</hi> Whether it is not a great wrong to a State-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to discover that it cannot be supported but by Persecution? and whether it is not one great Reason why Popery is so generally hated in <hi>England,</hi> because of the Butcheries they have made among innocent men, and that it is their Principle to persecute and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all that differ from them; for though Interest and malice may blind some, yet generally <hi>Englishmen</hi> hate such kind of proceedings and the Actors of them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query XVIII.</hi> Whether Moderation in a Prince is not that

               <hi>Query XIX.</hi> Whether the Nations are not so filled with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of <hi>Liberty,</hi> that what ever is done, if this be not, they will be dissatisfied? and whether if all the Votes of the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were taken, there would not be a greater number by much for <hi>Liberty,</hi> than there would be against it?</p>

               <hi>Query XX.</hi> Whether the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> are not dealt with about their <hi>Liberty,</hi> as the <hi>Christians</hi> were by the <hi>Heathens</hi> of old, <hi>Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before they are Heard,</hi> or <hi>their Arguments answered?</hi> and whether the common way of proceeding against them, is not to call them, <hi>Rogues, Traytors, Schismaticks, Fanaticks;</hi> never considering that they are <hi>Englishmen,</hi> that have as good Interest in the soil as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and as capable and ready to do the Nation service; nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver answering the Arguments they bring for their Opinions, nor for their <hi>Liberty?</hi>

               <hi>Query XXI.</hi> Whether if the Magistrate must force men in things pertaining to the Worship of God, and unite them in their practice, it were not more agreeable to force those that think the things they practise <hi>Indifferent,</hi> to leave of the practising of them, than to force those that think them <hi>Sinful</hi> to practise them.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Query XXIII.</hi> Is it not inconsistent with Reason, to practise a ruining severity towards the Members of the same Society, for things which neither themselves, nor any others are detrimented by; and when the dissent proposed to be persecuted, is unavoide able unto them in whom it is; whereas all Government hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect in punishment, to the Wills of the Offenders, and the Safety of others?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query XXIV.</hi> Whether the Kings <hi>Proclamation,</hi> and the House
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57443:5"/>of Commons <hi>Votes</hi> for <hi>Persecution,</hi> do not exceedingly gratify their Enemies abroad, and at home? There's no greater Friend to our neighbouring Nations than <hi>Persecution</hi> and <hi>Uniformity</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> For thereby the Trade of the Nation comes amongst them; the most industrious Tradesmen are driven to them, and much of the Riches and Treasure of the Nation, and abundance of the most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent hands in <hi>England;</hi> and so consequently the Nation weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and impoverished. As to your Enemies at home, they know there is nothing makes more for the settlement of the Government, the honour of the Magistrates, and security of the Publick, than to grant <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> and therefore this severity pleaseth them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query XXV.</hi> Whether the things for which these men are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted and ruined, are not so plausible, that all unprejudiced per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons will pitty them and joyn with them, seeing that they suffer for worshiping God according to his mind and their Consciences, as they have often declared and proved, and because they will not worship him in a way contrary to his mind and their Consciences, and if they did not do the one, and leave the other undone, they should sin against their Consciences?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query XXVI.</hi> Whether the <hi>Liberty</hi> desired, is not so rational a thing, that no unprejudiced persons, that mind the good of the Nation, can pretend a reason why it should be denied, seeing it is desired only for <hi>Protestants,</hi> such as own the same Religion, for the substance of it, with all other <hi>Protestants</hi> in the Nation; and seeing that all that are to have an Interest in it shall give sufficient securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Civil Magistrate for their peaceable living under the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government; and that they provide their places for Meeting without any publick charge; and that their Meetings are to be open, and under the inspection of the Magistrate, and that any may hear what they preach: Their Preachers expect no publick preferments, and they will be alwayes ready to give an account for what they speak or do: What reason can there be to deny this <hi>Liberty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu. XXVII.</hi> Whether the Effects of this <hi>Liberty</hi> are likely to be so dangerous that therefore it should be denied? Some say, <hi>That many would not go to their Parish Churches;</hi> What hurt can this be when they pay their Tythe to the Priest of the Parish, and go where they of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Principles go? Others say, <hi>It would
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57443:6"/>spread the Non-conformists Opinion.</hi> What hurt can there be in that, while it is their opinions, and accordingly they teach men to be loyal subjects to the King of Heaven and Earth, and obedient to all lawful Magistrates on Earth, to live to the glory of God, the benefit of the Publick, and their own good? Others fear <hi>that the Nation would see, that there was no necessity for the conformable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to have such great Revenues.</hi> This is no necessary consequence of <hi>Liberty,</hi> neither would it in the least prejudice the Publick good if their Revenues were lestened, that the Kings Majesty might be able therewith to manage the Publick Affairs of the Nation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out laying such heavy Taxes upon his Subjects; and the Clergy might have more time to follow their Studies. But would not <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conscience,</hi> granted to the Kings <hi>Protestant Subjects,</hi> satisfie the minds of the generality of the Nation, unite them in their indeavours for Publick good, encourage them in their Trades, fill the Nation with the Knowledge of God. And is not this the way to have God to bless us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu. XXVIII.</hi> Whether the persons gratified by the severity against <hi>Nonconformists</hi> are so considerable, that the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should wave the Publick good for their sake? For, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Clergy, who are there for it but persons that have particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Interests, or are carrying on some particular Designs, which they fear will be prevented by <hi>Liberty;</hi> or some persons that will not wave their Particular humours for the Publick good. Are the Clergy so considerable, that, to gratifie their humours, multitudes of <hi>Englishmen</hi> must be persecuted and ruined, who are faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, men industrious in their Callings, contributing greatly in their particular places to the Publick good. Whereas the Clergy that are gratified by the threatned severity, are persons for the generality of them, perfectly lost in their Reputation amongst all sorts of men, even many that are really for Episcopacy; persons much exempted by their Celling and condition from serving the pub ick Interest of the Nation; persons that, though they are the Instigators to this severity, yet cannot answer the Arguments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed for their <hi>Nonconformity;</hi> and yet are thus disingenuous to desire to have them persecuted and ruined; persons that for the most part enjoyed places before the Kings Restouration, and were
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57443:6"/>as conformable to those times as to these; only many were kept off, as being scandalous in their Lives, or ignorant, and a very few went away, as sticking to his Majesties Interest, thinking <hi>that</hi> the best and surest way to become Bishops; persons that do in no wise advantage the Crown, but get great Revenues from it; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that never cared to what danger they brought the State, to preserve their own Interest, but would rather ruine the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate and Interest, than lose any of their vast Power, Dignities and Preferments; persons, that though they pretend great readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to submit to and carry on his Majesties Interest, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the whole Nation, yet, whenever they conceive his Majesties Mind, with the Nations Interest, do thwart their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Interest, who are more ready to oppose his Majesty than they, as is evident by their carriages of late? Are they not also persons more Hetrodox to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for the most part of them, than the <hi>Nonconformists?</hi> for, are they not <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Pelagians, Socinians,</hi> and <hi>Erastians?</hi> although they have large Consciences to those Articles, some of which are quite contrary to their Principles. Whereas the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> differ in nothing from the 39 Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but in Ceremonies and Discipline. Besides, the most ingenious and learned among the Clergy themselves, are really for <hi>Liberty of Conscience.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Premises, and then I hope you will in your Wisdom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the persons gratified by this severity, not so considerable, as to ruine the Nation to humour them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu. XXIX.</hi> Whether the Interest of the Clergy is so conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as to save the Nation, if all that differ from them were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed? I suppose none will imagine. For I verily believe had the King and Parliament thought of an Act to degrade the Bishops, and to add their Land to the Crown, and send able Preachers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the People, I suppose there had been Petitions sent to the Magistrates, to beg the furthering of it, from most Counties and Cities in <hi>England,</hi> they are so generally lost in their Reputations amongst the generality of men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu. XXX.</hi> Whether if the Supream Magistrates make sinful Laws, the Inferiour are free from guilt in putting them in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Or, whether the Inferiour in executing, are not as guilty as the Superiour in making them?</p>
